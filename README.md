<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][image1]
### Project Description
The Dream Team is a Q & A based website, following a Jungian-based psychoanalytic approach, which serves the purpose of allowing users to gain some clarity into the symbols present in their dreams by recieving feedback/ analysis' from users on their dreams. Users are able to post a dream, rate dreams, customize their profiles, view other user's profiles, and view other user's dreams. The website is currently incomplete and only showcases the front-end aspects. The website utlises Symfony, a PHP based application framework for the development (utilising twig templates to showcase the front-end), Composer to install the necessary dependancies, and Heroku to deploy the actual website.
### Built With
* [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
## Concept Process
* I began with compiling a moodboard to gain inspiration and choose an appropriate concept for the website.
* After settling on the concept of the Dream Team, I designed a variety of different logos and compiled lo-fi wireframes to have a rough idea of the design.
* I then designed the hi-fi wireframes, a user flow diagram, and an entity relationship diagram.
### User-flow
